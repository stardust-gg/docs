title: "Migrating from Stardust Managed"
---

This guide is designed to assist clients in transitioning from the Stardust Managed API to Stardust Wallets as a Service (WaaS). Stardust Wallets as a Service offers a more streamlined and efficient way of managing digital assets and transactions. Follow these steps to smoothly migrate from Stardust Managed API to Stardust WaaS.

Before deciding to migrate to WaaS, it is important to review the [Product Overview](/product-overview) documentation. You have the option to use the WaaS [SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stardust-gg/stardust-custodial-sdk) or the [API](/api-reference) for your integration.

Get started by creating an app and up to 100 free wallets in the [WaaS Dashboard](https://waas.stardust.gg/).

## Migration Steps:

1. Manage smart contracts for each of the collections you will be migrating
2. Create Profiles for your existing players
3. Integrate WaaS into your game's asset and transaction logic

## 1. Manage Smart Contracts

It is important to identify the assets and functionality that are essential to keep in your game. In the Stardust Managed API product, all blockchain assets were minted under Stardust-owned smart contracts. 

There are two options to maintaining functionality of these contracts and their assets.

a.) Stardust can transfer ownership authority of the wallets over to you. In this case, you would not need to re-deploy the contracts or re-mint the assets. You can simply transfer the assets to the WaaS wallets. If you are interested in this option, please reach out to support@stardust.gg.

b.) Re-create and redeploy the contracts to your blockchain(s) of choice. Once your smart contracts have been deployed and profiles have been created for each of your players, you can then begin to mint copies of the old assets into the new WaaS wallets. You will then ensure that the assets are held within the new wallets. 

## 2. Create Profiles

In the Stardust Managed API product, you would create a player object that included an attached wallet. In the WaaS product, you will create [Profiles](/typescript-sdk/profiles/profiles-overview). These profiles will include a wallet with addresses for EVM, Solana, and Sui chains. You are able to use one profile and wallet across any supported chain.

You will create profiles for each of your existing players. You will need to store the `profileId` alongside the unique player id in your system, along with their new `walletId`. You will also need to update your authentication mechanism to create profiles for new players that sign up for your game. 

You can choose to use [profile identifiers](/typescript-sdk/profiles/profile-identifiers) to map back to the old `playerId`.


## 3. Integrate SDK

Update your game's asset management and transaction logic to leverage Stardust Wallets as a Service for handling digital assets and signing for transactions.
