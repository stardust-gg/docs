## Overview
### What is a Profile?
Stardust Profiles enable developers to create a profile for each player, allowing client-side authentication and account linking. This provides more security and flexibility for developers, as well as facilitating analyses like understanding where requests are coming from. Stardust Profiles also lay the groundwork for features like payments, KYC, and cross-device accounts.

### Why use Profiles?
Using Stardust Profiles provides several benefits. It allows for client-side requests, resulting in a faster experience for players due to fewer server calls. It enhances security by utilizing a token that can only control a specific player. Profiles also offer developers greater flexibility when the code is client-side, making it easier to incorporate custodial into existing non-custodial code. Furthermore, they provide valuable insights for developers, such as the origins of requests and player identities, which can be used for user acquisition strategies. Lastly, Profiles lay the groundwork for client-side specific features like payments, KYC, and cross-device accounts.

## Examples


### Default Profile Creation
By default, creating a profile will allow you to access identifers such as external wallet linking, google identifiers, and wallet functionality in one.

```TypeScript profile.ts
import { StardustCustodialSDK } from '@stardust-gg/stardust-custodial-sdk';

const STARDUST_API_KEY = 'your-api-key';
const sdk = new StardustCustodialSDK(apiKey);
const application = await sdk.getApplication();
const profile = await sdk.createProfile(application.id, 'My Profile Name'); 
const profileId = profile.id;
```
<Warning>You must save this identifier as it is single identifier for accessing all functionality of wallet</Warning>

### Accessing a profile's wallet
```TypeScript profileWallet.ts
import { StardustCustodialSDK } from '@stardust-gg/stardust-custodial-sdk';

const STARDUST_API_KEY = 'your-api-key';
const sdk = new StardustCustodialSDK(apiKey);
const profile = await sdk.getProfile(profileId);
const { wallet } = profile;
```

You can then use this wallet according to the [Wallet documentation](./wallets).
