### What is a Profile?
Profiles is a new feature for WaaS that help you understand your users and acquire similar players.

Profile Identifiers give you a place to store information about your players.

A Stardust Wallet is attached to every Profile.


### Why use Profiles?

<Card title="Understand who is playing your game" icon="address-card" iconType="duotone">
See Profile specific analytics, like how many of your players have an external wallet connected.

<Card title="Leverage the data to acquire similar users" icon="display-chart-up-circle-dollar" iconType="duotone">
If you are also a Stardust UA client, you can leverage this data to help acquire more users.

This opens up client side requests from our API, as a leaked JWT is not as dangerous as a leaked API key.

## Examples


### Default Profile Creation
By default, creating a profile will allow you to access identifers such as external wallet linking, custom identifiers, and wallet functionality in one.

```TypeScript profile.ts
import { StardustCustodialSDK } from '@stardust-gg/stardust-custodial-sdk';

const STARDUST_API_KEY = 'your-api-key';
const sdk = new StardustCustodialSDK(apiKey);
const application = await sdk.getApplication();
const profile = await sdk.createProfile(application.id, 'My Profile Name'); 
const profileId = profile.id;
```
<Warning>You must save this identifier as it is the single identifier for accessing all functionality of a profile</Warning>
