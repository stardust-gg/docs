### What is a Stardust Profile?

Stardust Profiles allows game developers to do more than just have a scalable custodial wallet for every player, by also giving unique insights into who is playing your game and how valuable they are, and in future how to acquire more players like them to your game.

### Profile Creation

Creating a profile allows game developers to easily interact with the Stardust custodial wallet, link external wallets, custom identifiers, and more. 

```TypeScript profile.ts
import { StardustCustodialSDK } from '@stardust-gg/stardust-custodial-sdk';

const STARDUST_API_KEY = 'your-api-key';
const sdk = new StardustCustodialSDK(STARDUST_API_KEY);
const application = await sdk.getApplication();
const profile = await sdk.createProfile('My Profile Name'); 
const profileId = profile.id;
```
<Warning>You must save this identifier as it is the single identifier for accessing all functionality of a profile</Warning>
