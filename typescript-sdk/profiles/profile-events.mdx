### What is a Stardust Profile Event?

Profile Events allow you to track various interactions and actions within a user profile. This can be used to monitor user interactions, transactions, and more, providing valuable insights into user behavior and engagement.

### Adding an IP event 

To track the IP address of a user, you can use the following code snippet. This will log either an IPv4 or IPv6 address associated with the user profile:

```TypeScript event.ts
await profile.events.addIp(<ipv4 or ipv6>);
```

### Adding a purchaseable event 
To track a purchasable item associated with a user profile, you can use the following code snippet. This will log a record of the item with its associated details:
```TypeScript event.ts
const item = {
    id: '12345',
    name: 'Premium Subscription',
    price: '9.99'
};
await profile.events.addPurchaseable(item);
```
<Warning>This purchaseable object is limited to a depth of 1, if you wish to store deeper properties, we recommend flattening or encoding into a json string</Warning>
