### What is a Stardust Profile?
Stardust Profiles allows game developers to do more than just have a scalable custodial wallet for every player, by also giving unique insights into who is playing your game and how valuable they are, and in future how to acquire more players like them to your game. 

### Why are Profiles valuable?

By understanding who is playing your game, Stardust can help you acquire higher quality players for your game more cheaply and at scale

With profiles, you can optionally embed wallet control into a game client without leaking any secure information such as an API or server-based key
</Card>

Wallets are no longer a top-level object, but instead contained within a profile

### What the existing integration currently looks like 

``` typescript ts
// Get Wallet
const wallet: StardustWallet = await sdk.getWallet(walletId);

// Get Ethers V5 Signer
const signer = wallet.ethers.v5.getSigner().connect(provider);
```

### What the new integration will look like 

Now, you will access the Wallet from within the Profile:
``` typescript ts
// Get Wallet
const profile = await sdk.getProfile(profileId);
const { wallet } = profile;

// Get Ethers V5 Signer
const signer = wallet.ethers.v5.getSigner().connect(provider);
```

### To get the full value of profiles, check out profiles identifiers and the overview page to get started creating profiles and adding identifiers
