### What is a Profile?
Profiles are a new Beta feature for WaaS that help you understand your users and acquire similar players.

A wallet is now part of a profile. Previously, a wallet was created for every player like this:
``` typescript ts
// Get Wallet
const wallet: StardustWallet = await sdk.getWallet(walletId);

// Get V5 Signer
const signer = wallet.ethers.v5.getSigner().connect(provider);
```

Now, you will access the Wallet from within the Profile:
``` typescript ts
// Get Wallet
const profile = await sdk.getProfile(profileId);
const { wallet } = profile;

// Get V5 Signer
const signer = wallet.ethers.v5.getSigner().connect(provider);
```

And Profile Identifiers can be added to the profile, detailing the player:
``` typescript ts
await profile.addIdentifier(StardustProfileIdentifierService.Google, userInputGoogleId);
```

### Why use Profiles?

<Card title="Understand who is playing your game" icon="address-card" iconType="duotone">
See Profile specific analytics, like how many of your players have an external wallet connected (coming soon).

If you are also a Stardust UA client, you can leverage this data to help acquire more users.

This opens up client side requests from our API, as a leaked JWT is not as dangerous as a leaked API key.

## Examples


### Default Profile Creation
By default, creating a profile will allow you to access identifers such as external wallet linking, google identifiers, and wallet functionality in one.

```TypeScript profile.ts
import { StardustCustodialSDK } from '@stardust-gg/stardust-custodial-sdk';

const STARDUST_API_KEY = 'your-api-key';
const sdk = new StardustCustodialSDK(apiKey);
const application = await sdk.getApplication();
const profile = await sdk.createProfile(application.id, 'My Profile Name'); 
const profileId = profile.id;
```
<Warning>You must save this identifier as it is the single identifier for accessing all functionality of a profile</Warning>

### Accessing a profile's wallet
```TypeScript profileWallet.ts
import { StardustCustodialSDK } from '@stardust-gg/stardust-custodial-sdk';

const STARDUST_API_KEY = 'your-api-key';
const sdk = new StardustCustodialSDK(apiKey);
const profile = await sdk.getProfile(profileId);
const { wallet } = profile;
```

You can then use this wallet according to the [Wallet documentation](./wallets).
