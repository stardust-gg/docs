## Overview
### What is a Profile?
Stardust Profiles enable developers to create a profile for each player, allowing client-side authentication and account linking. This provides more security and flexibility for developers, as well as facilitating analyses like understanding where requests are coming from. Stardust Profiles also lay the groundwork for features like payments, KYC, and cross-device accounts.

### Why use Profiles?
Using Stardust Profiles provides several benefits. It allows for client-side requests, resulting in a faster experience for players due to fewer server calls. It enhances security by utilizing a token that can only control a specific player. Profiles also offer developers greater flexibility when the code is client-side, making it easier to incorporate custodial into existing non-custodial code. Furthermore, they provide valuable insights for developers, such as the origins of requests and player identities, which can be used for user acquisition strategies. Lastly, Profiles lay the groundwork for client-side specific features like payments, KYC, and cross-device accounts.

## Examples

### Default Profile Creation
By default, creating a wallet will now also create a profile. You can access the `profile` object through the `wallet` object.

```TypeScript profile.ts
import { StardustCustodialSDK, StardustWallet } from '@stardust-gg/stardust-custodial-sdk';

const STARDUST_API_KEY = 'your-api-key';
const sdk = new StardustCustodialSDK(STARDUST_API_KEY);
const wallet: StardustWallet = await sdk.createWallet(); // also creates profile
const walletId = wallet.id;

// PLAYER PROMPTED TO ADD SOCIAL
// add specific social
const social = userInputGoogle;
wallet.profile.addGoogle(social);
// or generic
const social = userInput;
wallet.profile.addIdentifier(social.service, social.id);
```

### Adding Multiple Wallets to a Profile
In some cases, you may want to add multiple wallets to a player. This can be helpful if you want to keep different assets in different wallets. In this example, you will retrieve the Profile first and pass it in on wallet creation.

```TypeScript multi-wallet.ts
import { StardustCustodialSDK, StardustWallet } from '@stardust-gg/stardust-custodial-sdk';

const STARDUST_API_KEY = 'your-api-key';
const sdk = new StardustCustodialSDK(STARDUST_API_KEY);
// get profile by Player info
const playerInfo = db.playerInfo
const profile: StardustProfile = await sdk.getProfile(playerInfo);
const wallet: StardustWallet = await sdk.createWallet(profile);
const walletId = wallet.id;
```
