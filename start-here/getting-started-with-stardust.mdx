### Creating an Application
To create an application in the Dashboard, simply click the `+ Create App` button. It is recommended to create separate Stardust Applications for your development and production environments.

### Getting Your API Key
When creating an Application, you will receive a private API key that is only viewable once. Be sure to save your API key in a secure server-side location. If lost or compromised, it is always possible to delete the old key and create a new one.

### Managing Teams

Creating a Team allows you to invite other members to access your Apps in the Dashboard. Simply click on the Team tab in the left side menu, and click the `+ Add Members` button to add members by email address. 

It is possible to create multiple teams, and you can use the drop-down menu to switch between them. Soon, you will be able to assign roles and permissions to members of your Teams.
